# Mastra Course Deployment Guide

## Problem Analysis

Your Render deployment failed because:
1. **Missing Build Step**: Render wasn't running `mastra build` before starting the server
2. **LibSQLStore Incompatibility**: File-based storage doesn't work in serverless environments

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

I've fixed your project by:
- ‚úÖ Removed file-based `LibSQLStore` from main configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated memory agent to use in-memory storage (`:memory:`)
- ‚úÖ Added Vercel deployer for easy deployment
- ‚úÖ Verified build process works correctly

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Go with Vercel** because:
1. It has the best Mastra integration
2. Your project is now configured for it
3. It's the most developer-friendly
4. It handles the build process automatically
5. It has excellent documentation and community support

## üöÄ Quick Start with Vercel

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** and sign up

5. **Deploy!** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

Your app will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you get build errors:
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Check that your `package.json` has the correct build script
- Verify that all dependencies are installed
